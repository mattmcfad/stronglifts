						<h2>Ideology and Goals</h2>

						<h3>Ideology</h3>
						
						<p>I believe that if you have a consistent diet and exercise routine then you will receive results. To ensure consistency and track my progress I constantly record my results. For each and every workout I track each exercise by recording the number of sets, how many reps, and the working weight. I count my caloric intake by recording everything from each meal, protein shake, multi-vitamin and supplement to even how many beers I drink and physical activity. This helps me stay on track to achieve my goals and indicates to me when my progress starts to decay.</p>

						<p>The only way to measure muscular gain is to physically measure your muscle. Using a tape measure I record the circumference of my waist, chest, biceps, quads and calves. A scale is not a good assessment of muscular gain or weight loss. If I weigh 250lbs and after 4 weeks of working out I am at 240lbs, did I just lose 10lbs of fat or did I gain 5lbs of muscle and lose 15lbs of fat? Without measuring your muscles you cannot track your results.</p>

						<p>Without properly tracking my progress I would workout and diet blindly without an accurate validation of my progress</p>
						
						<h3>Goals</h3>
						
						<p>Before starting any fitness routine I define and set my goals to help me build a plan. This way I can have a concrete objective set and a goal to work towards. This increases motivation and keeps me dedicated to the routine</p>

						<p>My current plan is to build Strength and Size, my fitness goals for the next 6 months:</p>
						<ul>
							<h4>Size Goals</h4>
							<li>Increase my body weight from 170lbs -> 185lbs</li>
							<li>Remain under 15% body fat</li>
							<h4>Strength Goals</h4>
							<li>Increase my working weight on the big 3 lifts: 
								<ul>	
									<li>Deadlift 255lbs -> 315lbs</li>
									<li>Squat: 250lbs  -> 300lbs</li>
									<li>Bench press 170lbs -> 225lbs</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>I want to achieve these goals by October 1st.</p>
						<p>My Strength goals are realistic, for my compound lifts I want to move up about 50-60lbs in each exercise. Over 6 months this is just an increase of 10lbs per month or 2.5lbs a week.</p>
						<p>My Size goals will be my biggest challenge, increasing 15lbs over 24 weeks means I need to gain 0.625lbs a week. This is attainable by increasing my daily TDEE by 400-500kCal per day.</p>

						<h3>My Plan</h3>
						<p>How I plan on achieving this goals are through a strict diet and consistent exercise routine. There is no other way. The diet will be my biggest challenge as I have never been a big eater. I only need to work out 3-4 times a week but I have to eat right 3x per day, 7 days a week with the exception of 1 <q>cheat day</q>.
						</p>

						<p>My guide is geared around my goals, if your goal is to lose weight (body fat), you can still benefit from this guide as increasing your strength will increase your lean body mass. If you diet correctly by decreasing your daily TDEE by 500kCal you can lose 1lb of fat a week while increasing muscle mass.</p>

						<p>I calculated my current TDEE to be 2465 kCal, meaning I need to aim for 3000 Calories per day to gain 0.625-1lb of Mass (not muscle).</p>

						<p>I recommend using either TDEE Calculator:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/" title="TDEE Calculator">IIFYM TDEE Calculator</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://www.muscleandstrength.com/tools/bmr-and-daily-calorie-calculator.html" title="TDEE Calculator">Muscle & Strength TDEE Calculator</a></li>

						<h2>Exercises</h2>
						<h3>My initial weightlifting attempts</h3>
						<p> I started bodybuilding 4 years ago and for the first 2 years I had no idea what I was doing. I stuck to free-weights and followed a typical split routine that would work one body part once per week. I gained results but I found with a complex routine with many different workouts for each day it was very difficult to track and record my progress. During this time I did not record any of my workouts, and I gauged my results by stepping on a scale and looking in the mirror. The only exercise I was passionate about was Bench Press, which I always knew how much my working weight was. But for the other 5 exercises for chest I never knew the working weight, when I started that specific weight, or when I should move up.</p>

						<p>It took me almost 2 years into working out before I started doing Squats with free-weights. I never attempted Deadlifts. My results were initially great, I went from a frail 150lbs to 160lbs fairly quickly, but never went above 12% body fat, meaning I was muscular but still very skinny. I eventually peaked at 165lbs and never understood why I could never gain more weight. The answer: I never recorded my TDEE, counted calories, followed nutrition or stuck to a diet.</p>

						<p>After almost 2.5 years of working out I stopped working out regularly and for the next 2 years I would go through periods of 2-4 months where I would attempt to get back into working out but always fail to be consistent.</p>

						<h3>What I'm doing now</h3>
						<p>In February 2014 I finally did my research, made a plan, and became dedicated to a real workout routine. I have be following Medhi's StrongLifts 5x5 exercise routine. It is a very popular beginner workout routine that focuses on Full Body exercises. 2 weeks into February I changed my diet, started eating right and began the StrongLifts routine.</p>

						<p>StrongLifts 5x5 is a Full Body workout routine that only has 2 alternating workouts, Workout A and B. The beauty of StrongLifts is that every workout you increase your working weight by 2.5lbs, thus you are always progressing. I couldn't believe it. In the past I had stayed at plateaus using the same weight for months, StrongLifts was different. </p>

						<h3>The Routine</h3>
						<table>
							<tr>
								<th scope="col">Workout A</th>
								<th scope="col">Workout B</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><a href="exercises.html#squat">Squat 5x5</a></td>
								<td><a href="exercises.html#squat">Squat 5x5</a></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><a href="exercises.html#bench">Bench Press 5x5</a></td>
								<td><a href="exercises.html#oh_press">Overhead Press 5x5</a></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><a href="exercises.html#row">Barbell Row 5x5</a></td>
								<td><a href="exercises.html#deadlift">Deadlift 1x5</a></td>
							</tr>
						</table>

						<p>It doesn't get simpler than this. You alternate between workout A and B and increase the weight by 2.5lbs every workout. This means you increase your squats by 7.5lbs every week. </p>

						<h4>What does 5x5 mean?</h4>

						<p>5x5 refers to 5 sets of 5 reps. For <a href="#deadlift">Deadlift 1x5</a> you only do 1 set of 5 reps</p>

						<h2>Diet & Nutrition</h2>

						<p>I have found that Diet and Nutrition to be the most important aspect to any successful fitness goal. You simply cannot gain results by working out and eating like crap. Even if your goal is to bulk up, if you eat junk food you will put on excess body fat that you will have to end up shedding later on. Eating junk food will not give you optimal food intake for any workout plan.</p>

						<p>My Diet consists of eating 3 big meals, 1 protein shake and a sizeable snack everyday. Staying consistent with my diet has been very time consuming, however it has yielded me the best results.</p>

						<p>For every meal I try to get some green veggies, a large serving of meat/protein and good amount of carbs.</p>

						<h3>My Typical Daily Meals</h3>
						<ul>
							<h4>Breakfast:</h4>
							<li> Breakfast A:
								<ul>
									<li>3 Scrambled Eggs with 1 cup of mixed cheese</li><li> 1.5 cups of Oats</li>
									<li>Green Tea</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li> Breakfast B:
								<ul>
									<li>1.5 Cups of Oats</li>
									<li>4 x English Muffins with 1tbls of Peanut butter on each</li>
									<li>Green Tea</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<h4>Lunch</h4>
							<li>Lunch A:
								<ul>
									<li>6oz Chicken Breast fried on skillet</li>
									<li>1 cup of Broccoli & Green beans</li>
									<li>1 cup of Brown Rice or Quinoa</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Lunch B:
								<ul>
									<li>8oz + 4oz Hamburger Patty + 1cup of mixed cheese</li>
									<li>Hamburger Bun</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Lunch C:
								<ul>
									<li>Subway Meatball Sub add Pepperoni</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<h4>Dinner</h4>
							<li>Dinner A:
								<ul>
									<li>8oz Strip loin Steak or 6oz Chicken Breast</li>
									<li>1 cup of Broccoli & Green beans</li>
									<li>1 cup of Brown Rice and Quinoa</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Dinner B:
								<ul>
									<li>Various Meat</li>
									<li>Veggies</li>
									<li>Canned Pasta or Beans</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<h4>In Between Meals</h4>
							<li>Protein Shake:
								<ul>
									<li>2 Scoops of Mutant Mass</li>
									<li>2tbls of Peanut butter</li>
									<li>2 Ice cubes</li>
									<li>500ml of Milk</li>
									<li>250ml of Water</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Potential Snacks:
								<ul>
									<li>1 Cup of Almonds</li>
									<li>Peanut butter on Toast</li>
									<li>Can of Beans or Pasta</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>This diet is fairly bland so I try to alternate between lunch and dinners A,B or C. I have stayed fairly consistent and seen sizable gains in my weight and muscle mass. I find this diet puts me at ~500 calories above my TDEE and gives me an even distribution of Protein/Carbs/Fat.</p>

						<h2>Matt's Results</h2>

						<p>I started StrongLifts on February 24th 2014 and have completed 12 StrongLift workouts. For the first 3 weeks I started off doing 3 workouts per week however as school picked up and I found myself travelling between Oshawa and Toronto frequently I cut down to 2 times then once per week now. However every workout I gave it 100% and went up 2.5lbs per exercise.</p>

						<h3>My results from February 24th - April 1st:</h3>

						<ul>
							<li>Weight Gain
								<ul>
									<li>Starting Weight: 165lbs</li>
									<li>Current Weight: 174lbs</li>	
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Waist Size
								<ul>
									<li>Starting Waist Size: 32"</li>
									<li>Current Waist Size: 34"</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Bench Press 145lbs -> 170lbs</li>
							<li>Deadlift 135lbs -> 225lbs</li>
							<li>Squat 185lbs -> 250lbs</li>
							<li>Overhead Press 85lbs -> 100lbs</li>
							<li>Barbell Row 90lbs -> 115lbs</li>
						</ul>
						<p>My Squat strength gains have been incredible. I wish I had measured the thickness of my quads before I started because I have noticed significant size increase including tightness in previously baggy jeans. Before Stronglifts I had never Deadlifted before. I had a slight learning curve with proper technique and form before I started moving up. I actually injured my back for about 3 weeks which caused me to work machines for Deadlift and Barbell Row. After recovering I fixed my form and started gaining weight.</p>
