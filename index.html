				<h2>Ideology and Goals</h2>

				<h3>Ideology</h3>
				<p>I believe that if you have a consistent diet and exercise routine then you will receive results. To ensure consistency and track my progress I constantly record my results. For each and every workout I track each exercise by recording the number of sets, how many reps, and the working weight. I count my caloric intake by recording everything from each meal, protein shake, multi-vitamin and supplement to even how many beers I drink and physical activity. This helps me stay on track to achieve my goals and indicates to me when my progress starts to decay.</p>

				<p>The only way to measure muscular gain is to physically measure your muscle. Using a tape measure I record the circumference of my waist, chest, biceps, quads and calves. A scale is not a good assessment of muscular gain or weight loss. If I weigh 250lbs and after 4 weeks of working out I am at 240lbs, did I just lose 10lbs of fat or did I gain 5lbs of muscle and lose 15lbs of fat? Without measuring your muscles you cannot track your results.</p>

				<p>Without properly tracking my progress I would workout and diet blindly without an accurate validation of my progress</p>
				<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>Before starting any fitness routine I define and set my goals to help me build a plan. This way I can have a concrete objective set and a goal to work towards. This increases motivation and keeps me dedicated to the routine</p>

				<p>My current plan is to build Strength and Size, my fitness goals for the next 6 months:</p>
				<ul>
					<h4>Size Goals</h4>
					<li>Increase my body weight from 170lbs -> 185lbs</li>
					<li>Remain under 15% body fat</li>
					<h4>Strength Goals</h4>
					<li>Increase my working weight on the big 3 lifts: 
						<ul>	
							<li>Deadlift 255lbs -> 315lbs</li>
							<li>Squat: 250lbs  -> 300lbs</li>
							<li>Bench press 170lbs -> 225lbs</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I want to achieve these goals by October 1st.</p>
				<p>My Strength goals are realistic, for my compound lifts I want to move up about 50-60lbs in each exercise. Over 6 months this is just an increase of 10lbs per month or 2.5lbs a week.</p>
				<p>My Size goals will be my biggest challenge, increasing 15lbs over 24 weeks means I need to gain 0.625lbs a week. This is attainable by increasing my daily TDEE by 400-500kCal per day.</p>

				<h3>My Plan</h3>
				<p>How I plan on achieving this goals are through a strict diet and consistent exercise routine. There is no other way. The diet will be my biggest challenge as I have never been a big eater. I only need to work out 3-4 times a week but I have to eat right 3x per day, 7 days a week with the exception of 1 <q>cheat day</q>.
				</p>

				<p>My guide is geared around my goals, if your goal is to lose weight (body fat), you can still benefit from this guide as increasing your strength will increase your lean body mass. If you diet correctly by decreasing your daily TDEE by 500kCal you can lose 1lb of fat a week while increasing muscle mass.</p>

				<p>I calculated my current TDEE to be 2465 kCal, meaning I need to aim for 3000 Calories per day to gain 0.625-1lb of Mass (not muscle).</p>

				<p>I recommend using either TDEE Calculator:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/" title="TDEE Calculator">IIFYM TDEE Calculator</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.muscleandstrength.com/tools/bmr-and-daily-calorie-calculator.html" title="TDEE Calculator">Muscle & Strength TDEE Calculator</a></li>
