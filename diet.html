				<p>Your Diet will be the most significant and difficult part of any fitness goal. After years of bodybuilding I had always believed the most important aspect of gaining muscle was what you do inside the gym. I was sadly mistaken. I found myself quickly put on 10lbs to go from 150lbs - 160lbs then slowly crept up to 165lbs but never gained a pound more. I was determined it was bad genetics and that I physically could not gain any more weight. The truth was I wasn't eating enough.</p>

				<p>Working out is the fun part. Your diet is what takes the most effort. I workout 3 times a week and play hockey on an off day, I have to maintain a strict diet 7 days a week, cooking 3 healthy meals a day on-top of a protein shake. This is what it takes to reach my goals, lots of dedication to a healthy diet.</p>

				<h2>Calculating your TDEE</h2>

				<p>Whether you plan on gaining or losing weight you always need to calculate your TDEE. Your TDEE is how many calories your body needs to consume daily in order to maintain your current body weight. If you wish to lose weight then eat 500 calories less than your TDEE and you will lose 1lb / week. If you wish to gain then you must eat 500 calories above your TDEE.</p>

				<p>I calculated my current TDEE to be 2465 kCal, meaning I need to aim for 3000 Calories per day to gain 0.625-1lb of Mass (not muscle).</p>


				<p>I recommend using either TDEE Calculator:</p>

						<h2 id="bulk">Bulking Diet</h2>

						<p>Currently I am focused on bulking to 185lbs while keeping my body-fat under 15%. This means I cannot carelessly eat junk food and expand my gut to get me there. I need to eat clean and healthy and put on lean mass with minimal excess fat. There is no advantage to putting on lots of fat because you will end up having to lose that fat when you intend to get lean by lowering your body-fat to 9-11%. When you cut it is very difficult to put on any lean mass and typically you will lose muscle mass in the process. That is why I intend to slowly gain lean mass so I can minimize my cutting phase.</p>

						<p>My Diet consists of eating 3 big meals, 1 protein shake and a size-able snack everyday. Staying consistent with my diet has been very time consuming, however it has yielded me the best results.</p>

						<p>For every meal I try to get some green veggies, a large serving of meat/protein and good amount of Carbs.</p>

						
						<h3>My Typical Daily Meals</h3>

						<ul>
							<h4>Breakfast:</h4>
							<li> Breakfast A:
								<ul>
									<li>3 Scrambled Eggs with 1 cup of mixed cheese</li><li> 1.5 cups of Oats</li>
									<li>Green Tea</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Green Tea increases testosterone production, Scrambled eggs and Oats has a healthy portion of Carbs and Protein to kick-start my day. Sometimes I substitute or add Fried Bacon Strips. </p>
							</li>
							<li> Breakfast B:
								<ul>
									<li>1.5 Cups of Oats</li>
									<li>4 x English Muffins with 1tbls of Peanut butter on each</li>
									<li>Green Tea</li>
								</ul>	
								<p>When I am in a hurry or don't feel like frying Eggs or Bacon I tend to just lather Peanut butter onto toasted English Muffins. This is not ideal however it does pack in a lot of calories, 90kCal per tbls.</p>
							</li>
							<h4>Lunch</h4>
							<li>Lunch A:
								<ul>
									<li>6oz Chicken Breast fried on skillet</li>
									<li>1 cup of Broccoli & Green beans</li>
									<li>1 Cup of Brown Rice or Quinoa</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This is my typical meal. I almost eat this once a day. It contains a great balance of Protein, Green Veggies and Carbs. I intend to increase the Chicken portion.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Lunch B:
								<ul>
									<li>8oz + 4oz Hamburger Patty + 1 cup of mixed cheese</li>
									<li>Hamburger Bun</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This meal packs loads of calories, Protein and Fat. It's great for pushing me above my TDEE for the day. I Make sure to include Veggies into my next meal.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Lunch C:
								<ul>
									<li>Subway Meatball Sub add Pepperoni</li>
								</ul>
								<p>this is a last resort for when I am on the run. It is the best portion of protein for the price on their menu.</p>
							</li>
							<h4>Dinner</h4>
							<li>Dinner A:
								<ul>
									<li>8oz Strip loin Steak or 6oz Chicken Breast</li>
									<li>1 cup of Broccoli & Green beans</li>
									<li>1 cup of Brown Rice and Quinoa</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Dinner B:
								<ul>
									<li>Various Meat</li>
									<li>Veggies</li>
									<li>Potatoes, Pasta or Beans</li>
								</ul>
								<p>I sometimes have home cooked meals where I have Pork, Chicken, Beef, Veal or Fish. In this case I nicely ask for a portion of Carbs in the form of Potatoes, Beans or sometimes Quinoa.</p>
							</li>
							<h4>In Between Meals</h4>
							<p>I usually have a Protein Shake about an hour after a Meal or 1.5hours before a workout. This ensures I will not be too bloated before my next meal. When I know I have a large break between meals and I am hungry I try to snack on something healthy</p>
							<li>Protein Shake:
								<ul>
									<li>2 scoops of Mutant Mass</li>
									<li>2 tbls of Peanut butter</li>
									<li>2 ice cubes</li>
									<li>500ml of Milk</li>
									<li>250ml of Water</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The Protein Shake is make or break for my diet. Without my shake I will fall under my TDEE. I use a Weight Gainer called <a href="http://www.iammutant.com/products/mutantmass.php" alt="Protein Gainer">Mutant Mass</a> which has 530 calories per 2 scoops with 26grams of Protein. I then add Milk and 2-3 tablespoons of Peanut butter to add in more calories and protein. I estimate my average shake to contain around 800-900 calories as I tend to use more than 2 scoops.</p>
							</li>
							<li>Potential Snacks:
								<ul>
									<li>1 Cup of Almonds</li>
									<li>Peanut butter on Celery, Carrots or Toast</li>
									<li>Can of Beans or Pasta</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>This diet is not set in stone but is a guideline I tend to follow. I try to have a big breakfast with lots of Carbs and Protein, followed by 2 big meals that include a balance of Protein, Carbs and Veggies with high calories. </p>

				    		 TAB 2 - CUTTING
					****************************  -->
				    <div id="tab2" class="tab_content">

						<h2 id="cut">Cutting Diet</h2>

						<p>A cutting diet is uncharted waters for me. I have always struggled with weight gain and never in my life have I been over 15% bodyfat. I have not fully researched a full cutting diet however I do know a few tricks. You still want to make a change in weight in the same fashion, by reducing your TDEE by 500 calories and aim to lose 1lb a week. If you cut too much you will lose muscle mass. It is important to continue with consuming 1 gram of Protein / Kg in LEAN muscle mass. Therefore if you are 200lbs and you have 15% body fat, you would need 170 grams of Protein. Protein shakes are for cutting are illustrated <a href="#cutting_shake" alt="cutting shake">here.</a></p>

						<p>When I do begin my cut I will follow techniques illustrated in Tim Ferris's book called the <a href="http://fourhourbody.com/" alt="The 4 Hour Body - Book">4 Hour Body.</a> His fat loss recommendation involves a diet called the <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/04/06/how-to-lose-20-lbs-of-fat-in-30-days-without-doing-any-exercise/" alt="Slow Carb Diet.">Slow Carb Diet which includes the following 4 rules:</a></p>

						<h3>Rule 1. Avoid "White Carbs". This includes:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Bread</li>
							<li>Rice</li>
							<li>Cereal</li>
							<li>Potatoes</li>
							<li>Pasta</li>
							<li>Fried food with breading</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Rule 2. Eat the following meals over and over again:</h3>

						<p>The most successful dieters, regardless of whether their goal is muscle gain or fat loss, eat the same few meals over and over again. Mix and match, constructing each meal with one from each of the three following groups:</p>

						<h4>Proteins:</h4>

						<ul>
							<li>Egg whites with one whole egg for flavor</li>
							<li>Chicken Breast or thigh</li>
							<li>Grass-fed organic Beef</li>
							<li>Pork</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Legumes:</h4>

						<ul>
							<li>Lentils</li>
							<li>Black beans</li>
							<li>Pinto beans</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Vegetables:</h4>

						<ul>
							<li>Spinach</li>
							<li>Asparagus</li>
							<li>Peas</li>
							<li>Mixed Vegetables</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Eat as much as you like of the above food items. Just remember: keep it simple. Pick three or four meals and repeat them. Almost all restaurants can give you a salad or vegetables in place of french fries or potatoes. Surprisingly, I have found Mexican food, swapping out rice for vegetables, to be one of the cuisines most conducive to the “Slow Carb” diet.</p>

						<p>Most people who go on “low” carbohydrate diets complain of low energy and quit, not because such diets can't work, but because they consume insufficient calories. A 1/2 cup of rice is 300 calories, whereas a 1/2 cup of spinach is 15 calories! Vegetables are not calorically dense, so it is critical that you add legumes for caloric load.</p>

						<p id="cutting_shake">I would also recommend taking a single protein shake without milk or peanut butter and instead of Whey, use Isolate for pure protein.</p>


						<h3>Rule 3. Don't Drink Calories</h3>

						<p>Drink massive quantities of water and as much unsweetened iced tea, tea, diet sodas, coffee (without white cream), or other no-calorie/low-calorie beverages as you like. Do not drink milk, normal soft drinks, or fruit juice. I’m a wine fanatic and have at least one glass of wine each evening, which I believe actually aids sports recovery and fat-loss. Recent research into resveratrol supports this.</p>

						<h3>Rule 4. Take One Day Off per Week.</h3>

						<p>One day of the week you go wild, and eat WHATEVER you want. Ice-cream, alcohol, chocolate bars, pizza. It is your cheat day. This day is NECESSARY. It helps by dramatically spiking caloric intake and increases fat loss by ensuring that your metabolic rate doesn't down regulate from extended caloric restriction. That's right: eating pure crap can help you lose fat.</p>
