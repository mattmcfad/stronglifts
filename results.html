				<p>My results are from a 6 week period where I followed <a href ="exercises.html" alt="StrongLifts 5x5 Exercises">StrongLifts 5x5</a> for exercises and a strict <a href="diet.html#bulk" alt="bulking diet">bulking diet</a>. Prior to starting the program I exercised about 3-4 times with various free weight full body routines to get used to weightlifting again. I did this to get rid of the initial soreness from getting back into a weightlifting groove after a long break. </p>

				<p>Prior to starting the program I gradually started altering my diet to prepare for the strict diet. Before Christmas I had been eating poorly, sometimes only twice a day with no vegetables or fruits, lots of junk food and minimal lean protein. I began learning to cook and becoming accustomed to cooking healthy meals daily.</p>
			
				<h2>My Initial Stats</h2>

				<p>My weight in January was about 160lbs. From January onto mid February I put on 5lbs through more consistent eating patterns, ensuring everyday I had at least 3 big meals.</p>
				<h3>My body Measurements:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>165lbs</li>
					<li>Waist size 32"</li>
					<li>Bicep thickness 13.5"</li>
					<li>Bodyfat % ~13%</li>
				</ul>
				<p>My biggest mistake at the first trial of StrongLifts was not taking body measurements. I wish I had used a tape measurer and measured the thickness of my Quads, Calves, Glutes, Chest, Hips and wrists. My Bicep, Waist and Bodyfat % measurements are approximations that are not precise.</p>
				<p>Before my next phase I will take full body measurements with a tape measurer and bodyfat% with calipers.</p>
				<h3>My working weight for the first two workouts:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Bench Press: 145lbs</li>
						<li>Deadlift: 135lbs</li>
						<li>Squat: 185lbs</li>
						<li>Overhead Press: 85lbs</li>
						<li>Barbell Row: 90lbs</li>
						<li>Preacher Curl: 50lbs</li>
						<li>Chin-ups: 6 Reps</li>
						<li>Dips: 8 Reps</li>
					</ul>

				<p>After my third or fourth workout I started incorporating 3 sets of hypertrophy Preacher Curls, Chin-ups, and Dips to the end of my workouts to receive a nice pump at the end of my workout in my arms. After my Squats reached 225lbs I found myself doing this less and less as the regular StrongLifts workout would take too much out of me.</p>

						<h2>Weight Gains</h2>

						<p>I would measure my weight only after a minimum of 7 days had passed. I always ensure to use the same scale for accuracy. I measure in the morning after a bowel movement and urination on an empty stomach.</p>

						<p>The first measurement on Day 12 was shocking. I had put on nearly 7 pounds in 2 weeks. This was a result from the sudden increase in my TDEE from my diet. I had started taking daily protein weight gainer shakes that account for ~800-1000 calories. This was certainly putting me well above my needed caloric intake to gain lean muscle. If I put in more than 750kCal above my TDEE my body will put those calories into fat. This is evident as I started to gain a gut after the first two weeks.</p>

						<p>I had kept such a strict diet the first two weeks that it was driving me insane. I then started to cheat a bit and ended up eating a little less, drinking less of my gainer shakes, eating an occasional junk food meal and drinking lots of beer. Yet I thought I was gaining as much weight! Until I weighed in on Day 19 to realize I had barely gained half a pound in a week. After gaining almost 3.5lbs in my first two weeks I was frustrated and became more strict on my diet.</p>

						<p>The third weigh in I had put on 1.5 lbs on in a week. I wasn't sure if my 2nd weigh in was inaccurate or if the third weigh in wasn't, but I appeared to be back on track and making progress. This motivated me to continue eating healthy. This was also when I started noticing that my pants were becoming tighter around the waist. in 32" jeans I started to un-do the top button as the tension would be uncomfortable. This is how I estimated my waist size to become around 34"</p>

						<p>The last 2 weeks of March was a very busy time for me. I was overwhelmed with schoolwork, decisions of post grad opportunities and a conflicting social life. As a result my workouts had dropped down to only once a week and I struggled to continue the bare minimum for my diet. However on the 4th weigh in I had still gained half a pound. Still progress, but perhaps it was time to increase my diet intake as I suspected my regular diet for the month of March was giving me calories <= 500 above my TDEE which is not enough to gain weight.</p>

						<p>April and May will be better.</p>

					<h2>Strength Gains</h2>

					<p>By far the most rewarding part of this StrongLifts program has been my consistent strength gains. Starting off with Squatting 1 45lb plate on each side and working my way up to 2 was both satisfying and motivating. Dieting properly is the hard part, working out is what I look forward to.</p>

					<p>I am very proud of my Squats and Deadlift as they are the most significant increase in strength. However this is also because they are using the biggest muscles in the body, Quads and Hamstrings. I injured my Back for a couple weeks which hindered my Barbell Rows progression. I also started to hit a plateau with Overhead press, this is normal because the shoulders are so much smaller of a muscle compared to those used by squats. Many participants of StrongLifts encounter this problem. I intend on working through it. My gains in Bench Press are not as amazing as my Squats or Deadlift but I still maintained an increase of 7.5lbs per week which is great.</p>

					<p>I only had 3 exercises where I incorporated Preachers, Chin-ups and Dips however I did manage to increase in all of them. I would go for 3 sets of high reps. Preacher increased significantly and after reaching 20 reps in Dips I felt I would have to add chains/weight to my body to continue to increase my 1RM.</p>
