				<h2>Linear results</h2>

				<p>The workout routine focuses on increasing your weight on each exercise by 2.5lbs every workout. This is crucial for success in the program. After gaining the first 50lbs in my lifts on Squats I was sure that I would plateau, however as every new squat exercise became harder I would persevere. It is paramount that you move up weight. As long as you maintain a healthy diet and get plenty of rest this is attainable.</p>

				<h3>Should I warm up?</h3>
				<p>Absolutely! You should not walk into the gym and attempt to lift extremely heavy weight without first warming up. This is a quick and easy way to get injured.</p>
				<p>For each exercise I usually do:
					<ol>
						<li>5-6 slow reps with just the bar</li>
						<li>3-4 reps with 50% of working weight</li>
						<li>2-3 reps of 75% of working weight</li>
						<li>1-2 reps of what I did 2 weeks ago</li>
					</ol>
				<p>I would much rather find out I have tweaked or pulled something using 50% or 75% of the weight I normally do.</p>
				<p>Warming up is important to get the blood flowing to your muscles and prepare you mentally for pushing more weight</p>

				<h3>Should I do Cardio?</h3>
				<p>If you feel you need to do Cardio before the workout then only do 5 mins on the bike or treadmill. You do not want to burn through all your energy before lifting heavy weight</p>
				<p>30-45 min Cardio sessions are great, however you should do them either after your workout or during your rest days.</p>
				<p>You do not want to do HIIT the day before your workout as you may tire yourself out for the heavy lifting the next day.</p>

				<h3>Can I use Machines?</h3>
				<h4> Short Answer: No</h4>
				<p> You can, however you will never be working your stabilizer muscles with machines. This workout is intended to be a fully body exercise. Machines do not effectively target the full range of motion nor do they work the smaller secondary muscles in the lift. You will not achieve your full potential using machines</p>


				<h3>What does 5x5 mean?</h3>

				<p>5x5 refers to 5 sets of 5 reps. For <a href="#deadlift">Deadlift 1x5</a> you only do 1 set of 5 reps</p>

				<h2 class="headers" id="squat">Squats</h2>
				
				<p>	The Squat is a full body, compound exercise. You Squat by putting the barbell on your back and bending through your knees. Squatting works your hamstrings, quads, glutes, adductors and calves directly. But your abs and lower back also have to work to keep the bar stabilized under the weight.</p>

				<p>The Squat is king of all exercises. It releases more testosterone and growth hormone than exercises like the leg press. That’s why Squats are crucial for getting stronger and building muscle. Nothing I did in the gym worked until I started to Squat. You have to Squat. And you’ll Squat 3x/week on StrongLifts 5×5.</p>

				<p>Many people are afraid Squatting will hurt their knees. Yet I’ve been Squatting for 14 years and my knees are fine. So are the knees of all my Members. Squats are even effective for rehabilitation from ACL injuries. The key is to Squat with proper form. That means:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Move your hips back – think sitting of a toilet, pushing your hips back on the way down</li>
					<li>Push your knees out – don’t let them cave in, keep your knees aligned with your toes</li>
					<li>Hit parallel – go down until your hip joint is lower than the top of your knees</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Squatting parallel will strengthen your knees, not hurt them. It’s Partial Squats, only going down 90°, that will hurt your knees. Partial Squats work mostly your quads, not your hamstrings. This creates muscle imbalances and results in knee pain. Partial Squats are also less effective for getting stronger.</p>

				<p>There are many different style of Squats. On StrongLifts 5×5 you’ll do a low bar Squat. Lowering the bar on your upper-back, to the top of your shoulder-blades, puts your torso more incline. This shifts the stress from your knees to your stronger hips. So you can lift more and get stronger Squatting low bar.</p>

				<p>The safest way to Squat is in the Power Rack. The safety pins will catch the weight if you miss a rep so you can’t get stuck under the weight. If your gym has no Power Rack, find a real gym. Or buy a Power Rack for your home as I’ve done. You must be able to Squat safely alone to get stronger.</p>


				<h2 class="headers" id="bench">Bench Press</h2>

				<p>The Bench Press is a compound upper-body exercise. You do it by lying on your back, lowering the bar to your chest, then pressing it back up until your elbows are locked. The Bench Press works your shoulders, triceps and chest. It also works your abs and back to stabilize the bar, and your biceps to hold it.</p>

				<p>The Bench Press is the most popular exercise in the gym. It’s also the upper-body exercise you can lift the most weight on, more than the Overhead Press. This makes the Bench Press the most effective strength and mass builder for your upper-body. You’ll do it every other StrongLifts 5×5 workout.</p>

				<p>Many guys hurt their shoulders Benching. Usually they’re benching with bad form: bodybuilding-style, with elbows flared 90°, to get a bigger chest stretch. Don’t bench like this on StrongLifts 5×5. Keep your elbows in at about 60°. This way you’ll get stronger without hurting your shoulders.</p>

				<p>You must use a full range of motion when you Bench Press. Using a full range of motion builds more strength and muscle than partials. Don’t do half reps, don’t be a Half-way Harry. Go all the way down until you touch your chest. And lock your elbows at the top so your skeleton holds the weight.</p>

				<p>There’s no incline or decline benching on StrongLifts 5×5. You cannot isolate your upper or lower chest. Your chest contracts as a whole. Your upper-chest has to work hard when you bench heavy. So by taking your Bench Press to 100kg/220lb, your entire chest will grow bigger.</p>

				<p>To avoid getting stuck under the weight, bench inside the Power Rack. The safety pins will catch the bar if you fail a rep. If you don’t have a rack, ask somebody to spot you. Or don’t put collars on the bar so you can tilt it to one side if you get stuck. The plates will drop on the floor though, power rack is better.</p>


				<h2 class="headers" id="oh_press">Overhead Press</h2>
				<p>The Overhead Press is a full body compound exercise. You do it standing by pressing the weight from your shoulders over your head until your elbows locked. The Overhead Press works your shoulders, triceps and upper-chest. It also works your legs, back, abs and traps to stabilize the weight.</p>

				<p>The Overhead Press is the best exercise to build stronger, bigger shoulders. It also keeps your shoulders healthy – the <a href="#bench">Bench Press</a> works mostly your front shoulders. But the Overhead Press strengthens your back shoulders as well. By alternating the Bench and Overhead Press you avoid imbalances.</p>

				<p>Some people are intimidated by lifting a weight overhead. They fear the weight will drop on their head. Yet the Overhead Press is the safest of all exercises: if you can’t lift the weight, it won’t leave your chest. Just start light, add 2.5kg/5lb each workout, your confidence will increase.</p>

				<p>You can get lower back pain if you let your lower back hyper-extend. Like with the other exercises, you must keep your back neutral when you Overhead Press. Keep your ribcage down and squeeze your glutes hard. Don’t let your lower back arch and you won’t get back pain.</p>

				<p>Overhead Press with your feet about hip-width apart so you have maximum stability and strength. Don’t do a Military Press with your heels together or your strength will plummet. Don’t do a Push Press either, your legs must remain locked from start to finish otherwise it’s cheating.</p>

				<p>Press from the rack. If you don’t have one, clean the weight from the floor on your shoulders. If your ceiling is too low, press outside. If you can’t, do the Seated Press. But keep your lower back neutral, it’s easier to get hurt on the Seated Press. And it won’t build strong abs like the Overhead Press.</p>

				<h2 class="headers" id="row">Barbell Row</h2>
				<p>The Barbell Row is a full body compound exercise. You do it by pulling the bar from the floor against your lower chest in a bent-over position. This works your upper-back, traps, lats and biceps. The muscles of your lower back, abs and legs also have to work hard during Barbell Rows to stabilize the weight.</p>

				<p>Barbell Rows are the best exercise to strengthen your upper-back. This improves your Bench Press by increasing stability when lying on the bench. Barbell Rows also keep your shoulders healthy and injury-free by strengthening your rear shoulder muscles so you don’t get imbalances.</p>

				<p>To avoid lower back pain, you must keep your lower back neutral when you Barbell Row. Keep your chest up so your lower back doesn’t round. But don’t hyper-extend by excessively arching your lower spine. Raise your chest while keeping your ribcage down so your lower back stays neutral.</p>

				<p>Start each rep with the bar on the floor, like on <a href="#deadlift">Deadlifts</a>. Push your knees out to make room for the bar to travel upwards. Your torso can come up slightly on the way up but don’t turn your Barbell Rows into Deadlifts. If your torso comes up more than 30°, the weight is too heavy.</p>

				<h2 class="headers" id="deadlift">Deadlift</h2>
				<p>The Deadlift is a full body, compound exercise. You do it by picking up the weight from the floor to your hips. This works your hamstrings, glutes, quads and adductors. But many other muscles have to work during heavy Deadlifts: your grip to hold the bar, your back to keep your spine from rounding, etc.</p>

				<p>I think <a href="#squat">Squats</a> are king but Deadlifts are definitely queen. The Deadlift is the exercise you’ll lift the most weigh on. It works even more muscles than the Squat. And it will release a ton of growth hormone and testosterone in your body. So Deadlifts are crucial for getting stronger and gaining muscle.</p>

				<p>Many guys fear hurting their back doing Deadlifts. Here’s the key: don’t let your lower back round. Keep it neutral. That’s how you build a strong lower back without getting hurt. That’s also how you build the habit of picking stuff off the floor with safe form, avoiding injuries outside the gym.</p>

				<p>One trick is to think of Deadlifts as a “push” exercise…</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Lift the weight off the floor by pushing through your feet (as if doing a leg press).</li>
					<li>Keep the bar in contact with your legs.</li>
					<li>Once the bar reaches knee level, thrust your hips forward.</li>
					<li>The lift ends when your hips and knees are locked. No need to lean back at the top.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>You’ll do the conventional Deadlift on StrongLifts 5×5, with your stance about hip-width apart. You won’t do sumo Deadlifts because the point is to strengthen your lower back. No Romanian or Stiff-legged Deadlifts either because you can lift more weight doing a conventional Deadlift.</p>

				<p>Deadlifts is only one set of five reps – not 5×5 like the other StrongLifts 5×5 exercises. 5×5 Deadlifts after 5×5 <a href="#squat">Squats</a> is too hard. Deadlifts are a different beast than <a href="#squat">Squats</a> because each rep starts from a dead stop. If you do 5×5 Deadlifts, you’ll quickly start missing reps and plateaus.</p>
